# Damped Oscillator Simulation

Here there are two simulations of two point masses attached to each other via a spring--the first simulation without a gravitating object in between them, and the second with one. I construct a first order differential equation of vectors to model the proposed scenario, integrate it with scipy, and plot various results including the trajectory over time.
